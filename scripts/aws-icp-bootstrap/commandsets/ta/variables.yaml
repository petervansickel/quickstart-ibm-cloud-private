# Custom variable and keyword map
# A minimum variables file must have a kind of variables and a VariableKeywordMap.
# When the command files use only IntrinsicVariables only a VariableKeywordMap is 
# needed to map the IntrinsicVariable names to macro names in the command files.
# A variables file may also have a VariableValues entry that provides a set of
# custom variables and their corresponding values. 
# All variables (intrinsic or custom) that are used in the command files must have  
# an entry in the VariableKeywordMap.

kind: variables

# IntrinsicVariables get assigned a value based on the ICP deployment.
# IntrinsicVariables do not need to have a value assigned to them in 
# the VariableValues table below.
# IntrinsicVariables that are used in command files for macro substitutions
# must have an entry in VariableKeywordMap below to map the macro name back 
# to the IntrinsicVariable name.
# IntrinsicVariables:
#  ClusterDNSName
#  ProxyDNSName
#  TBD - need to get the full list
#
# The VariableKeywordMap provides the mapping from the variable names
# defined in this file to the keywords used to define macro substitutions
# in the command files.
#
# The keywords are used in the command files in the same directory 
# as this variables file.  It turns out to be convenient to have
# one level of indirection between the variable names and the macro
# names used for macro substitution in the command files.
#
# NOTE: All IntrinsicVariables used in a command file and all variables 
# defined in the VariableValues table must have an entry in the VariableKeywordMap
# in order for the macro substitutions to be properly executed.
#
VariableKeywordMap:
  ClusterDNSName: CLUSTER_DNS_NAME
  ProxyDNSName: PROXY_DNS_NAME

# Custom variable values
# user name and password need to be base64 encoded
# user: admin
# password: secret01
VariableValues:
  TADB_UserName: YWRtaW4=
