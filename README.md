## Getting Started with IBM Cloud Private on AWS Quick Start

This Quick Start automatically deploys a multi-master instance of IBM Cloud Private into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

A regular deployment takes about 60 minutes, and a high availability (HA) deployment takes about 75 minutes. The Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates and a deployment guide with step-by-step instructions.

This Quick Start is for users who want to explore application modernization and want to accelerate meeting their digital transformation goals, by using IBM Cloud Private and IBM tooling. The Quick Start helps users rapidly deploy a high availability (HA), production-grade, IBM Cloud Private reference architecture on AWS.

IBM Cloud Private is a scalable cloud platform that can run on any on-premises infrastructure that's managed by either VMware or OpenStack, or on any cloud environment. IBM Cloud Private is used for developing and managing containerized applications, and includes the following:

- The container orchestrator Kubernetes 
- A private image registry
- A management console
- Monitoring frameworks
